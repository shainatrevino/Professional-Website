description: I am a Research Associate and Data Scientist at the [HEDCO Institute for Evidence-Based Educational Practice](https://hedcoinstitute.uoregon.edu/) and the [Prevention Science Insitute](https://psi.uoregon.edu/) at the University of Oregon. My work centers on leveraging data science and quantitative research methods to promote healthy child development and youth well-being. I specialize in developing efficient data science workflows for evidence syntheses and human subjects research, including computationally reproducible reporting, interactive web apps, and robust data management, harmonization, and analysis. My goal is to streamline the research process and produce accessible, actionable research products that help bridge the research-to-practice gap. Aside from research, I love spending time outdoors and kayaking the beautiful lakes and rivers across Oregon.
