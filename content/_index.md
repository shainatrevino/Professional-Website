description: I am a PhD candidate in the Prevention Science Program at the University of Oregon. My interests are in data science and quantitative research methodology with a focus on early childhood development and youth violence prevention. Currently, I am involved in projects that focus on privacy preserving data publishing, student and youth safety and well-being, and parent-child emotion and self-regulation processes. I enjoy applying my methodological skills to new challenges and collaborating with others to discover new, innovative ideas. Aside from research, I love spending time outdoors and kayaking the beautiful lakes and rivers across Oregon.
